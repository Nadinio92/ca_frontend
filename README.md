# Financial Application Web UI README

Welcome to the repository for the Companies and Research Analysts Web UI project. This project focuses on creating a dedicated web user interface (UI) for efficiently managing data related to IPO companies and Research Analysts. The UI is developed using Angular, a powerful front-end framework, and is enhanced with Angular Material to provide modern and user-friendly design elements.

## Features

- **Data Management Section:** This web UI offers a dedicated section for managing data related to IPO companies and Research Analysts. This ensures a streamlined and efficient process for handling essential information.

- **Angular Routing:** The application employs Angular's routing capabilities to enable seamless navigation between various components. This enhances the user experience by allowing swift transitions between different sections of the UI.

- **Angular Material Integration:** The UI is built using Angular Material, a UI component library that provides a collection of controls, forms, and dialogs with a contemporary and intuitive design. This integration enhances both the aesthetics and usability of the application.

## Getting Started

To view and interact with the web UI locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository:** Begin by cloning this repository to your local system.

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/companies-analysts-web-ui.git

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 13.1.2.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.

## Technologies Used

- **Angular:** A powerful front-end framework that enables the creation of dynamic and responsive web applications.
- **Angular Material:** A UI component library that provides pre-designed and customizable UI elements for a modern and user-friendly design.
